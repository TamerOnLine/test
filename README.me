# Python Code Formatter - PEP 8 Compliance

## Overview
This Python Code Formatter ensures that all provided Python code strictly adheres to the **PEP 8** standard. It automatically corrects style errors, improves code readability, and maintains best practices for clean and maintainable code.

## Features
- **Automatic Formatting:** Adjusts code indentation, spacing, and structure to match PEP 8.
- **Error Detection & Correction:** Identifies common formatting issues and applies fixes.
- **Explanations on Demand:** Provides detailed explanations for each modification upon request.
- **Supports All Python Code Sizes:** Works with both small snippets and large programs.
- **Logic Preservation:** Ensures that the code logic remains unchanged.
- **English Documentation & Comments:** All comments and explanations follow a standardized English format.

## Assumptions
- All submitted Python code is intended for PEP 8 compliance review.
- Non-Python code will be ignored, with feedback provided only on Python-related content.
- The formatter does not modify variable names or function names unless explicitly requested.
- No emojis or non-standard symbols will be used in formatted code or explanations.

## Best Practices for Clean Code
- **Consistent Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- **Line Length Limit:** Keep lines at a maximum of 79 characters.
- **Proper Spacing:** Maintain appropriate spacing around operators and after commas.
- **Clear Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- **Docstrings for Functions:** Provide meaningful docstrings for clarity.
- **Avoid Unused Imports:** Remove unnecessary import statements.

## How to Use
1. Submit your Python code for formatting.
2. Receive a PEP 8 compliant version of your code.
3. Request explanations for any modifications if needed.
4. Maintain best practices for future coding to ensure clean and readable code.
